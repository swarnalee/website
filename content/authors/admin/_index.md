My life is currently under construction (isn't it always though?).
I am a Civil Engineering undergraduate student at NIT Silchar :mortar_board:. I am fascinated by the amazing new advancements taking place in hydrological sciences, climate science, earth systems, sustainability and use of efficient tools for understanding problems better and solving them. 

Currently, I am working with [Dr. Subhrajit Dutta](https://sites.google.com/view/rulab/home).


Apart from academics, I enjoy reading books, running, spending time with my plants, music and reading about all the amazing science happening in various fields.
