My life is currently under construction (isn't it always though?).
I am a Civil Engineering undergraduate student at NIT Silchar :mortar_board:. It was during my junior year when I realised that I truly enjoy research work. I am fascinated by the amazing new advancements taking place in the various fields of Civil Engineering spanning from transport & network systems, geosciences to geotechnical engineering, uses of AI/ML for understanding problems better and solving them.

Currently, I am working with [Dr. Suprava Jena](http://www.nits.ac.in/departments/civil/civil.php) and with [Dr. Amit Kumar Das](http://www.nits.ac.in/departments/civil/civil.php).
In the past, I've worked closely with [Prof. Ashim Kanti Dey](http://www.nits.ac.in/departments/civil/civil.php).


Apart from academics, I dabble often in *human psychology (behavioural!)* and *space sciences*. I enjoy reading (and sometimes writing) blogs, making nice Spotify playlists :) and playing the Ukulele. Also, these days I am teaching myself to code.

Will be more than happy to connect! <a href="https://twitter.com/rawslayn?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false">Follow @rawslayn</a><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
