My life is currently under construction (isn't it always though?).

I am a final year Civil Engineering undergraduate student at NIT Silchar. I am fascinated by the recent advancements taking place at the intersection of natural sciences and technology. I am interested in learning and understanding more about the various earth processes including but not limited to hydrological sciences, climate science. I am more about STEAMED HAMS ([for more context](https://twitter.com/npseaver/status/1365462310463102983?s=20)) than just STEM. 

These days I am exploring Earth Sciences and the various computational tools that are used in the field, learning German and also trying to read more books!
